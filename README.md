This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Dependency Management

When updating dependencies, there are various files that must be kept up-to-date. Newly added, or updated dependencies can introduce unwanted/malicious scripts that can introduce risks for users and/or developers. The `lavamoat allow-scripts` feature allows us to deny by default, but adds some additional steps to the usual workflow.

`yarn.lock`:

- Instead of running `yarn` or `yarn install`, run `yarn setup` to ensure the `yarn.lock` file is in sync and that dependency scripts are run according to the `allowScripts` policy (set in `packages.json`)
- If `lavamoat` detects new scripts that are not explicitely allowed/denied, it'll throw and error with details (see below)
- Running `yarn setup` will also dedupe the `yarn.lock` file to reduce the dependency tree. Note CI will fail if there are dupes in `yarn.lock`!

The `allowScripts` configuration in `package.json`:

- There are two ways to configure script policies:
  1. Update the allow-scripts section manually by adding the missing package in the `allowScripts` section in `package.json`
  2. Run `yarn allow-scripts auto` to update the `allowScripts` configuration automatically
- Review each new package to determine whether the install script needs to run or not, testing if necessary.
- Use `npx can-i-ignore-scripts` to help assessing whether scripts are needed

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
